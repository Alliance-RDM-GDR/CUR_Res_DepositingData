The Tier Protocol is a guiding framework.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.200
There's no one-size-fits-all rule for organizing a data set.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.320
It depends on the content, discipline, and research context.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.880
However, frameworks like the Tier Protocol offer a solid starting point.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.200
Tier stands for, Transparency, Interpretability, ease of access and reusability.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.600
It provides a flexible structure that can be simplified or expanded based on your specific needs.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.160
On the right, you can see an example of a clean, organized data set structure based on this protocol.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.360
It clearly separates raw data, process data, scripts, documentation, and results, each in its own dedicated folder.
