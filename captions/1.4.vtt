00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
how research needs to evolve.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
To meet today's challenges and opportunities,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.700
research practices must evolve in three key ways.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
First, build competency in data management and analysis.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.500
Researchers need the skills to manage, document, and analyze data effectively.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.300
This includes understanding formats, metadata, documentation standards,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.800
and basic coding we're scripting when applicable.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.500
Second, adopt standardized approaches for sharing data and code.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Sharing raw data alongside the analysis code enhances transparency and reproducibility.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
Standardized methods make it easier for others to verify results and build upon them.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.800
Finally, foster a culture of transparency and best practices.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.300
We must promote a research culture that values openness, documentation, and reproducibility.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.800
This strengthens trust in science and ensures that research outputs remain useful and credible over time.
