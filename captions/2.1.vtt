00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Data could be in many places.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In most research environments, data are stored across a wide range of locations,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and often in an uncoordinated way.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They might be found on the laptops of students or postdocs,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
making them vulnerable to loss or inaccessibility when people leave the lab.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They could be saved within an institute's internal network,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which may be secure but not always organized for long-term preservation or sharing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Some data sets are stored in cloud services, such as Google Drive or Dropbox.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
These platforms are convenient but not designed for structured research data management,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and may lack clear ownership or metadata.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Other data reside on high-performance computing, HPC, clusters,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which support large-scale processing but don't always offer user-friendly interfaces

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for managing and sharing data sets.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This fragmentation makes it difficult to track, cure it, and preserve research data.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That's why centralized, well-curated repositories play such an important role in ensuring long-term access and reuse.
