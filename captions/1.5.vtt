00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Benefits for different stakeholders.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Sharing well-managed research data provides significant benefits across the research ecosystem,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with specific advantages for researchers, publishers, and funders.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For researchers, data sharing increases.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Efficiency

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It reduces duplication of effort and makes it easier to build on existing work.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Ease of resharing

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There is availability for all lab members and community.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Collaboration

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Data sets become a foundation for new partnerships and interdisciplinary projects.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Finally, reproducibility.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
While documented data allows others to validate findings and reinforce the integrity of scientific outputs.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
For publishers, open data contributes to.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
RIGER

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
By requiring that data be shared, publishers help ensure that research is based on transparent and verifiable evidence.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Validation

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Shared data allows reviewers and readers to assess the credibility of the work.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Open science

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This supports a broader cultural shift toward accessible and transparent research practices.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Also, for funders, data sharing enhances.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Transparency

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Public access to data demonstrates how research funds are being used.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Accountability

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Funded researchers are responsible for making their results openly available.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Return on investment

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
When data are reused and built upon, the impact of the original funding increases significantly.
