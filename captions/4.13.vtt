00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Beware of poorly formatted tables.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Although spreadsheets like Excel, .xls, .xlsx are widely used in research, they often result in poorly structured and unusable tables.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.500
In fact, tables are among the most problematic data objects in research due to formatting issues such as...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Merged cells that confuse parsing tools and make automation difficult.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.500
In consistent structures where multiple variables are crammed into a single column or row.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Next content such as tables combined with graphs, formatting, or commentary.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.500
These issues make data hard to clean, validate, reuse, or preserve.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Unfortunately, they're common, especially in supplementary materials of research articles.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
Good data practices start with structure.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.500
If your tables are not machine readable and logically organized, they lose much of their value for others and for future you.
