00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Why should we share and reuse research data?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
There are several key reasons.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
First, data sharing helps prevent duplication of efforts.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.500
By reusing existing datasets, we can save time, reduce costs, and avoid repeating experiments unnecessarily.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Second, sharing data promotes transparency and reproducibility.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Independent researchers can validate findings by replicating the original workflows.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In an era marked by concerns about research integrity and reproducibility, this is essential.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Third, shared datasets can be used to explore new research questions or combine with other data to generate novel insights.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.000
They are also valuable resources for teaching and training, offering students and early career researchers the opportunity to work with real-world data.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Finally, openly shared raw data supports large-scale analyses like meta-analyses, which rely on high-quality, reproducible research inputs.
