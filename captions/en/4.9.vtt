Define the structure of your data set.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To support reuse, your data set should be clearly and logically structured, ideally from the very beginning of the project.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Think of your data set as a matriache doll, where folders are nested inside one another in a meaningful way.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Each level should add context and help the user understand how the data are organized.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Surprisingly, this is often overlooked.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.500
In practice, many data sets are submitted with confusing or inconsistent folder structures, making them hard to interpret or reuse.
