00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What should a dataset contain?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.600
As depicted by the Tier 4.0 template, a well-prepared dataset typically includes several core components.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.000
Raw data

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.800
These are the original, unmodified files generated by instruments are collected during experiments.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Intermediate and analysis data

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.200
These are the cleaned, transformed, or filtered datasets used for analysis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.800
They represent the bridge between raw data and results.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Processing and analysis scripts

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Coder scripts that document how the data were cleaned, processed, or analyzed.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.800
These are essential for reproducibility.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.600
Output slash results

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Final outputs, such as graphs, summary tables, or statistical results, typically generated from analysis scripts.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.400
Readme files and codebooks.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.400
These provide context and documentation.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.800
The readme explains the dataset structure and codebooks describe variables, formats, and metadata.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.600
