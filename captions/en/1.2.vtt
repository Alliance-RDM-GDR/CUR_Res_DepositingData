00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Triagency Research Data Management Policy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In Canada, research data sharing is supported by the Triagency Research Data Management Policy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This policy reflects a commitment by the government of Canada to strengthen research data management

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and promote data sharing, particularly for projects funded with public money.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Its goal is to improve the return on investment in research by ensuring that data are preserved

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and made accessible for reuse without unnecessary restrictions.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The policy encourages the development of data management plans, DMPs, and the deposit of data entrusted repositories.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Over time, these practices are expected to become standard requirements across disciplines.
