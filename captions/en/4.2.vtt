00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
DataSets titles are essential.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's look at real examples from FRDR to illustrate the importance of descriptive dataset titles.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the first case, the dataset was submitted under the name PyPaw2.0, a name that gives little context.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
After curation, it was improved to reflect the dataset's nature and purpose.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A more informative version might be homecage-based motor learning platform PyPaw2.0.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Even small changes in a title can significantly improve clarity and usefulness.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In the second example, the addition of details like, what was mapped, and the technique used made the title much more meaningful and discoverable.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A good title should communicate what the dataset is, how it was generated, and what it's about.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You may not find the perfect title on your first try, but you can always aim for one that is clear, specific, and descriptive.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The first one is the final version of the title.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The first one is the final version of the title.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The final version of the title is the final version of the title.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The final version of the title is the final version of the title.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The final version of the title is the final version of the title.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The final version of the title is the final version of the title.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The final version of the title is the final version of the title.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The final version of the title is the final version of the title.
