00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In Borealis, data sets are organized into collections and subcollections that reflect institutional and research group structures.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Each institution or group has a top-level collection, which serves as the main container for its data sets.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.700
Data sets are deposited directly into these collections, or into subcollections created for specific labs, departments, or research units.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Some institutions allow individual researchers or teams to manage their own subcollections, offering greater control and flexibility.
