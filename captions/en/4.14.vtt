Share Tidy Formatted Tables

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To support reuse and reproducibility, share your data in Tidy Table Format.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This means organizing data so that each column represents a single variable.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Each row represents a single observation, and each value is clearly placed in its own cell.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In the example shown, the table follows a long format with identifier variables such as mouse ID, condition, and time point to help distinguish each experimental unit.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Analysis variables include counts of specific cell types used for interpretation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Also, derived variables, created during data processing, like ratios or proportions, are clearly labeled and separated.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This structure ensures that data are machine readable.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Files can be easily imported into analysis tools, and the dataset can be reused without confusion.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Avoid mixing multiple types of information in the same cell or formatting your table visually.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Instead, think in terms of data logic and clarity.
