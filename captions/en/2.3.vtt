00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Common issues in shared datasets.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Even in the few cases where data are shared, either upon request or as supplementary material in publications, serious issues are common.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The most frequent problems include

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Missing or incomplete metadata.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Without adequate context, it's impossible to understand how the data were generated or what the variables represent.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
No Read Me File.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Many datasets like a simple text file describing the content, explaining how to use the data, the structure of the files, or the methodology behind them.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Disorganized folder structures.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Files are often scattered without logic and naming conventions, making it difficult to navigate, interpret, or reuse the dataset.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Data sets treated as secondary.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Too often, data are considered in appendix to the publication, rather than a standalone research output with its own value and life cycle.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Together, these issues make reuse difficult, if not impossible, and diminish the long-term utility of research data.
