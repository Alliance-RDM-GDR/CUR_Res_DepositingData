What to include in a ReadMe file?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A well-structured ReadMe file should contain the following elements.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
DataSet identifiers

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Include the title of the dataset, the names of the authors or contributors, the dates of data collection, and any relevant geographic or contextual information.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This establishes the identity of the dataset.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
File and folder map

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Describe how the dataset is organized.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Outline the folder structure, list the files included, and explain any naming conventions used.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This helps others understand how to navigate the data.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Methodological information

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Provide a summary of how the data were collected or generated.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Mention tools, instruments, or protocols used, along with relevant experimental conditions.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Remember, the ReadMe should allow the dataset to stand alone, it should not rely on the associated publication for key details.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Instructions and software requirements

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Let users know how to access and work with the files.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If specific software or code is needed, list it and include any version requirements.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Finally, sharing and access information.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Clearly state the licensing terms and conditions for reuse.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Indicate whether the dataset is openly available or has restrictions.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We recommend using a Creative Commons CCBY license for broad reuse.
