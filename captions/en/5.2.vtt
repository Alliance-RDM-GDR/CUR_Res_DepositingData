00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Frequently asked questions about data sharing.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Here are common questions researchers often ask.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.800
1. When should I start organizing my data for sharing?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.600
The earlier, the better.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.800
Don't wait until the end of a multi-year project to impose structure.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.800
Start organizing as you collect the data.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.100
This prevents confusion, saves time, and improves data quality.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.800
2. When can I share my data?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.100
At any point in the research process.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.600
Data can be shared during ongoing projects, at the time of publication, or even afterward,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.200
as long as it's properly documented and structured.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.400
3. What if my data set doesn't fit a protocol like tier?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.600
That's okay.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.700
Protocols are guides, not rigid rules.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.100
The key is to create a logical structure and provide sufficient documentation

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.600
so others can understand and reuse your data.
