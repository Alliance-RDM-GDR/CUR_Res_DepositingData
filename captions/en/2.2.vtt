00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Data sharing promises versus reality.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.280
Although many research articles claim that data are available upon request,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.540
the reality often tells a different story.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.300
In practice, when researchers or reviewers attempt to access these datasets,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.480
the data frequently cannot be retrieved.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.680
There are several reasons for this.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.480
Poor data management.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.880
The data may be disorganized, stored on inaccessible devices, or simply lost over time.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.280
This includes loss of contact with the responsible.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280
Lack of preparation.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280
The data were never documented or formatted for sharing, making them unusable by others.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.080
Research misconduct.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.880
In some cases, the data never existed, and the claim of availability masks fraudulent practices.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.680
This disconnect between policy and practice highlights the need for proactive,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.280
transparent data sharing through trusted repositories and with appropriate documentation.
