00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Write a meaningful description.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.800
A good dataset description complements the title by providing additional detail about the dataset's contents, purpose, and structure.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.900
It should.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.400
Clearly state what the dataset includes.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
Describe how the data were generated or collected.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.300
Mention any methods or instruments used.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.900
And include relevant keywords to improve discoverability.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.200
In the example shown, the original description lacks context.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.000
It can be significantly improved by specifying what the data represent, how they were produced, and for what kind of research they might be useful.
