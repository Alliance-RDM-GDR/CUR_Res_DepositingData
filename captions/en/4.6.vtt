Choosing effective keywords.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.200
Selecting the right keywords is essential to make your dataset discoverable in repositories and search engines.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.200
When deciding on keywords, ask yourself.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
What terms would someone use to search for this dataset?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.800
Think about.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
The subject of the dataset.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000
For example, rodent behavior or climate modeling.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.600
Also, in the methods used, such as RNA sequencing or satellite imagery.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.400
Include the data types.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.800
For instance CSV tables or microscopy images.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200
Finally, make reference to relevant locations, species, or systems involved in the research.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.200
Avoid overly broad or generic terms, and instead focus on specific, descriptive words that reflect the content and context of the data.
