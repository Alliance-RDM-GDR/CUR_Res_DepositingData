00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Start structuring your data set early, but it's never too late.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Ideally, you should design your data set structure at the start of a project,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but if that wasn't done, restructuring it midway or even at the end is still worthwhile.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here are key elements to consider.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Folder Structure

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Organize data logically.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For example, create separate folders for raw data, process data, documentation, and analysis scripts.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Group-related files together and avoid clutter.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
File Formats

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Choose formats that are open and widely supported.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example, use CSV instead of Excel for tabular data, or TIFF instead of proprietary image formats like .sy.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Open formats support long-term access and reuse.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Naming conventions

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Use descriptive and consistent names for files and folders.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Avoid vague labels like data underscore final 2.xlsx.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Instead, use names that clearly describe the content or version.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The goal is to help others, and yourself, quickly understand the data set structure in contents, even years later.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We'll now look at tools and models that can guide this process.
