00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In summary, data first.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A data set is not just supporting material, it is an independent research output.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It can and should be used independently of the research article, cited independently, with its own DOI, and valued independently, as a contribution to science.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In fact, a shift in mindset is needed.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Instead of thinking of data as a supplement to your article, think of the article as a supplement to your data set.
