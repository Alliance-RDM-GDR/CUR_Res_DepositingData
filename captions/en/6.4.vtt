Borealis Network in Canada.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This map shows the institutional distribution of the Borealis Network across Canada.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Each point represents a participating academic institution that has integrated Borealis into its research data services.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The Broad Coverage reflects Borealis' national reach and decentralized model, where institutions manage their own collections within a shared infrastructure.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This structure enables local support while still maintaining high standards for metadata, discoverability, and long-term access through national coordination.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If your institution is part of the Borealis Network, you likely already have access to its services and local librarians who can support you.
