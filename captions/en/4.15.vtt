00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Coding is essential in research.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To ensure transparency and reproducibility, it's not enough to share data alone.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You also need to share the code used to transform and analyze it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This includes scripts used for, data cleaning and formatting, merging data sets, and generating figures or statistical results.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The code helps documenting the logic behind your results.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It allows others to replicate your steps and understand how raw data were transformed into final outputs.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Think of coding as a core research skill, just like experimental design or statistics.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Languages like R&Python are widely used, and modern tools, including AI assistants, make coding more accessible than ever before.
