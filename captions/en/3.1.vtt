00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Treat data as an independent research output.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A key priority in data sharing is to ensure that data sets are treated as independent, reusable research outputs, not as byproducts of a publication.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This means that the data set should be clear.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Others should be able to understand what the data represents without needing access to the original researchers.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Organized.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
File structures, naming conventions, and folder hierarchies should be logical and easy to follow.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well-documented.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Context, methodology, and file contents must be explained in sufficient detail.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
To illustrate this need, many of us have experienced situations where we inherit data from a former student or colleague, only to find it impossible to interpret or reuse due to a lack of documentation or structure.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
By documenting and curating your data effectively, you make it possible for others and for your future self to understand and build upon your work.
