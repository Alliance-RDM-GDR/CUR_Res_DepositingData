00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Data sharing is a professional responsibility.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.840
While policies and mandates can motivate data sharing, they should not be the sole reason

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.160
we share our research data.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.760
As researchers, we should view data sharing as a core professional and ethical responsibility,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.800
not just as a checkbox for grant applications or journal submissions, and certainly not

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
simply because it's mandated by policymakers.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.520
Sharing data contributes directly to the advancement of open science.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.680
It increases the visibility and impact of our work, allows others to build upon it,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.000
and ensures that research outcomes extend beyond individual publications.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.760
Ultimately, data sharing is part of conducting responsible, transparent, and collaborative

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.360
science.
