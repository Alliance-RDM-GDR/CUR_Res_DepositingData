00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This example reinforces a key idea.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Specificity adds value.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Including information such as the geographic location or study site makes the title more precise and immediately useful.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For example, adding a location can help users quickly determine whether a dataset is relevant to their work, especially in fields like ecology, public health, or environmental science.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Once again, remember.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The title of your dataset is not the same as the title of your research article.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
A dataset title should focus on the content, format, and context of the data itself.
