4. Is My Data Set Sightable?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes. When you deposit your dataset in a trusted repository like FRDR or Borealis, it receives a digital object identifier, DOI.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This makes your dataset a sightable, stand-alone research output.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can even cite the dataset in your article, especially if it's deposited before publication.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
5. How can others use my dataset?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That depends on the license you choose.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We recommend the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, CC by 4.0, license.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It allows broad reuse while requiring proper attribution.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
6. Where can I share my data?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You can deposit your data in either specialized repositories, tailored to your discipline, or in generalist repositories like FRDR, which supports curated, large-scale, multidisciplinary datasets.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Or Borealis, based on the Dataverse platform, and hosted by Canadian University Libraries.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We'll take a closer look at both in the next slides.
